Decentralised Data Infrastructure for Science
---
April 21st–22nd, 2018  The British Library, 96 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DB

Momentum is growing among research funding agencies, data preservation advocates, 
and individual researchers to increase the extent to which the scientific process 
and record is fully reproducible and transparent. In the context of data, 
this is most commonly referred to as making research data (and code, models, etc). 
findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable/reproducible (FAIR).

Distributed web technologies are well suited to meeting some of the challenges of 
creating a network infrastructure which natively facilitates FAIR data. 
Unlike existing approaches, where data is “published” long after the research 
has been carried out, technologies like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and 
DAT fit into the researcher's daily workflow throughout the research lifecycle, 
much as git fits into a software developer's daily flow throughout a 
given project lifecycle. However, for example, while IPFS natively simplifies 
the “A” (accessible) aspect of FAIR, there are gaps in terms of 
how it currently addresses the findability and interoperability of data.

Our group is actively working on use-cases that bridge the gap between IPFS 
(and other distributed technologies, e.g. ledgers and smart contracts) 
and existing scholarly communication infrastructures, from data repositories and linked data to DOIs and ORCIDs.
